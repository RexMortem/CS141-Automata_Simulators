  As stated in the ants.hs file, I used a profiling guide: https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/7.2.1/docs/html/users_guide/profiling.html

  For generating executable: 
  ghc -prof -fno-prof-count-entries -o executables/TESTNAME profile.hs

  For running executable (and producing the performance info) (need to be IN EXECUTABLES):
  ./TESTNAME +RTS -p

  Drag the generated prof file into profiles

  When executing the tests, try and ensure a minimum of other processes running. 
  Test averages are calculated as a mean average of 10 tests.

{-  PROFILE RESULTS
    
    You can inspect each of these manually (in the profiles folder).

    TEST 1: applyRuleWithRecursion vs applyRuleWithZip 

    applyRuleWithZip (s): 0.50, 0.55, 0.49, 0.50, 0.47, 0.50, 0.51, 0.49, 0.47, 0.48
    applyRuleWithZip(avg in s): 0.496

    applyRuleWithRecursion (s): 0.43, 0.40, 0.40, 0.41, 0.40, 0.40, 0.41, 0.41, 0.40, 0.41
    applyRuleWithRecursion (avg in s): 0.407

    applyRuleWithZip takes ~22% more time, on average, to execute than applyRuleWithRecursion
    Even if we consider the fastest zip run (0.47s), it is slower than the slowest recursion run (0.43s)
      
    So applyRuleWithRecursion is faster 

    TEST 2: applyRuleWithRecursion vs tailCallApplyRuleWithRecursion 

    Also I realise that starting it with "tailCall" is confusing because you might think it refers to "proper tail calls" 
    however I have already written the tests and it is MADE CLEAR HERE THAT IT IS NOT THAT. 
    It is just called that because it takes advantage of the function tail. 

    tailCallApplyRuleWithRecursion (s): 0.41, 0.46, 0.44, 0.43, 0.44, 0.45, 0.50, 0.49, 0.41, 0.42 
    tailCallApplyRuleWithRecursion (avg in s): 0.445
    We can reuse the applyRuleWithRecursion benchmarks from before: 

    applyRuleWithRecursion (s): 0.43, 0.40, 0.40, 0.41, 0.40, 0.40, 0.41, 0.41, 0.40, 0.41
    applyRuleWithRecursion (avg in s): 0.407

    So tailCallApplyRuleWithRecursion takes ~9.3% more time, on average, to execute than applyRuleWithRecursion 
    tailCallApplyRuleWithRecursion's times are quite inconsistent however with a large variation. 
    If we consider best cases: the fastest tailCall run (0.41s), it is slower than the fastest applyRuleWithRecursion run (0.40s)
    
    So applyRuleWithRecursion is faster
