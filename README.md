# Automata Simulators 

This project is a simulation of two cellular automata:
- 1D line automaton 
- Langton's Ant 

## Assessment 

**Final Mark:** 90 

A more detailed breakdown of the marks and assessment is outlined in the Assignment_Feedback pdf file.

This coursework rewards being able to write an efficient and elegant solution, being able to explain your code (in the comments), and also going above and beyond.

For anyone taking this module: I **wholly recommend** going above and beyond. I lost 10 marks on Exercise 9 because I implemented a minimal solution; if I were to do this again, I would have gone above and beyond by implementing other - more complex - automata.
